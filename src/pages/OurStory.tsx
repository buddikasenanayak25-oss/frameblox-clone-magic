              <p>
                Selenzo was born in 2020 from a simple idea: streetwear should be accessible, 
                authentic, and above all, a form of self-expression. Our founders, passionate about 
                urban culture and fashion, recognized a gap in the market for high-quality streetwear 
                that didn't compromise on design or affordability.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-foreground">Building the Brand</h2>
              <p>
                Starting from a small studio, we collaborated with local artists and designers to 
                create our first collection. The response was overwhelming. What began as a passion 
                project quickly evolved into a movement, with customers from around the world connecting 
                with our vision and aesthetic.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-foreground">Growth & Evolution</h2>
              <p>
                As we grew, so did our commitment to quality and innovation. We expanded our product 
                line, introduced limited edition drops, and built a community of loyal customers who 
                share our passion for bold, expressive fashion. Each collection tells a story, each 
                piece is crafted with intention.

                experiment with new designs, and stay true to our roots. Our commitment to sustainability, 
                quality, and community drives us forward as we shape the future of streetwear culture.
